$h1 Naming conventions

In all the documentation of the ${factoryNameHighlight} and its plugins, the
same naming conventions will be used.

Especially, the examples will follow the same rules.

---

$h2 Maven artifacts in examples

We consider that the company using the plugin is called <b>"company"</b>. Thus
the default <i>groupId</i> starts with <i><b>com.company</b></i>.
	
This company is developing a project called <b>"project"</b>. Finally, the
<i>groupId</i> of the project will be <i><b>com.company.project</b></i>.
	
We will add <i><b>bw</b></i> to this <i>groupId</i> for BusinessWorks related projects.
It will enable to create Java projects inside the client project with
<i><b>java</b></i> at the end of the <i>groupId</i> etc.

$h2 Command line examples

When we give command line samples to execute, we will always put them in this
quoted format:
	
```bash
mvn dependency:copy \
    -DoutputDirectory=. \
    -Dartifact=${factoryGroupId}:${factoryArtifactId}:${factoryVersion}:pom
```

${notaBene} the backslash '\\' at the end of line means that the command is not
finished and continue on the next line. However when using this command, a
single line must be typed.
