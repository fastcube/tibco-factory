# Introduction

The ${factoryNameHighlight} is a
<u>software factory</u> and must not be thought as a framework.

It will only give tools to <i>develop</i>, <i>build</i>, <i>package</i>,
<i>deploy</i>, <i>manage</i> and <i>monitor</i> TIBCO applications and
environments, but no actual implementation of functional or technical
services (such as ones found in frameworks: logging feature, generic error
handling and so on).

However, the ${factoryNameHighlight} will
dramatically improve the development of such a framework!

The ${factoryNameHighlight} is plugin-based and below is a description of
[each plugin](./default-versions.html). Before using a plugin, it is advised to
start with ${factoryNameHighlight} common [installation](./installation.html)
& [configuration](./configuration.html) instructions.
